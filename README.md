Docker is required to run this project and will eliminate the need to install other dependencies onto your machine. Once Docker is installed and running, ensure that ports 3000 and 9000 are not being used by other programs. Now simply open terminal in this directory and run "docker-compose up" to start the webapp. Navigate to localhost:3000 on a browser and enjoy!
